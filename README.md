# Windows Power Buttons

## About
A simple little application for windows with buttons to power-off/restart the system.

## Why?
I use it for remote desktop PC's, where you normaly have to use the command prompt to shutdown or restart, as these are disabled in the start menu when logging in via Remote Desktop Connection.
So this just makes it easier.

## Features
- Shutdown
- Restart
- Cancel a pending shutdown/restart
- Set a time in seconds before executing.
- Force shutdown/restart
- Startup with windows

## How much?
Free forever for anyone. :D
